# Infotainment System

A Flutter-based automotive infotainment system with weather information, music player, and location services. Designed for tablet interfaces with landscape orientation.

## Features

- üå§Ô∏è Real-time weather information and forecasts
- üéµ Music player with local file support
- üìç Location-based services and navigation
- üåç Multi-language support (English, Arabic, German)
- üé® Modern, responsive UI optimized for tablets
- üì± Landscape orientation support
- üîÑ Auto-refresh weather data
- üéØ Touch-optimized controls

## Architecture

This project follows the **MVC (Model-View-Controller)** pattern, organized as follows:

- **lib/models/**: Data models (e.g., Song, Weather, Settings, Location)
- **lib/controllers/**: Business logic and state management (e.g., MusicPlayerController, WeatherController, SettingsController, LocationController)
- **lib/views/**: UI screens and widgets (e.g., HomeScreen, MusicPlayerView, WeatherDetailsView, SettingsView)
- **lib/constants/**: Centralized constants (e.g., app_colors.dart)
- **lib/l10n/**: Localization files
- **lib/config/**: API and environment configuration

**State Management:**
- Uses [Provider](https://pub.dev/packages/provider) for dependency injection and state management.
- All main controllers are provided at the top level in `main.dart` using `MultiProvider`.

**API Key Check & HelloScreen:**
- On first launch, the app checks if a valid Google Cloud API key is set in `lib/config/api_config.dart`.
- If the API key is missing or invalid, a **HelloScreen** is shown with clear instructions and a language switcher (English/German) to guide the user.
- Once a valid API key is set, the full infotainment system UI is shown.

**Adding New Features:**
- Create a model for your data in `lib/models/`.
- Implement a controller in `lib/controllers/` for business logic/state.
- Build the UI in `lib/views/`, using Provider to access controllers.

**Constants & Assets:**
- Use `lib/constants/app_colors.dart` for color definitions and avoid hardcoding values in views.
- All assets (images, fonts) are managed in the `assets/` directory and referenced in `pubspec.yaml`.

## Tested Device

- **Device**: Xiaomi Redmi Pad SE 11-inch
- **OS**: Android 13
- **Orientation**: Landscape (recommended)
- **Screen Resolution**: 1920x1200

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK (latest stable version) - [Install Flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)
- Dart SDK (included with Flutter)
- Android Studio / VS Code
- Google Cloud API key (see [API Setup Guide](API_SETUP.md))
- Android device or emulator for testing

### First Launch & API Key Setup

- On first launch, the app will show a **HelloScreen** if the API key is not set.
- The HelloScreen provides step-by-step instructions and allows you to switch between English and German.
- To enable weather and map features, set your Google Cloud API key in `lib/config/api_config.dart` as instructed.
- After setting the API key, restart the app to access the full infotainment system.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repository-url>
   cd infotainment_system
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. Set up API keys (required for weather and maps features):
   ```bash
   # Follow the instructions in API_SETUP.md
   cp lib/config/api_config_template.dart lib/config/api_config.dart
   cp android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.template.xml android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml
   
   # Edit the files with your actual API keys
   # lib/config/api_config.dart - for Dart code
   # android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml - for Android Maps
   ```

4. Run the app:
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

## Testing

### Running Tests

1. **Unit Tests**:
   ```bash
   flutter test
   ```

2. **Integration Tests**:

```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **API Key Errors**:
   - Verify API keys are correctly set in configuration files
   - Check Google Cloud Console for API enablement
   - Ensure API key restrictions are properly configured

2. **Permission Issues**:
   - Grant storage permissions manually in Android settings
   - Enable location permissions for weather features
   - Check microphone permissions for voice features

3. **Build Errors**:
   ```bash
   flutter clean
   flutter pub get
   flutter build apk --release
   ```

4. **Performance Issues**:
   - Use release builds for performance testing
   - Monitor memory usage with Android Studio Profiler
   - Check for memory leaks in long-running operations

### Device-Specific Issues

**Xiaomi Redmi Pad SE**:
- Ensure MIUI optimization is disabled for the app
- Grant all necessary permissions in MIUI settings
- Check battery optimization settings

## Security

- API keys are stored in separate configuration files that are ignored by Git
- Never commit actual API keys to version control
- Use API key restrictions in Google Cloud Console for production
- Implement proper error handling to avoid exposing sensitive information

## Performance Optimization

- Use release builds for production testing
- Optimize image assets for tablet displays
- Implement proper caching for weather data
- Use efficient data structures for music file management
